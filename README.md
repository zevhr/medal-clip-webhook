<p align="center">Ever needed a second method to share your clips to Discord or Guilded but don't have the space for Medal, are building a community or are on Guilded and don't have <a href="https://medal.tv/medalbot">MedalBot</a> (which you should invite if you have Medal. Do not use this over MedalBot if you have the option!).<br>
<strong>You've come to the right place!</strong></p>

<p align="center">Platforms that can be POSTed to are Discord, Guilded, or maybe even Slack (if you're looking into that???)!<br>
This webhook is mainly for users who are building a community but don't clip games and just want a way for your users to share clips and/or are on Guilded or Slack.<br>
However, this webhook does not have some things that Medal has, like auto-uploading, integrated uploading, and more. I still sincerely recommend using <a href="https://medal.tv/download">Medal</a>, maybe even use my <a href="https://medal.tv/?ref=awex_partner">partner link</a> ;).</p>

				<h2 align="center">how to do the thing tho</h2>
					<p align="center">Well, you can do it <i>really</i> easily!<br>
						Navigate over to this <a href="https://mcw.awexxx.xyz">project site</a> and put in your information. <i>Do note none of this information is saved to a database at this moment, so all it's doing is passing your URL to Discord).
