            <h4>Help</h4>
                <p><strong>1 - Why is the thumbnail/timestamp different than mine???</strong><br>
                This is either because your clip has the same title as another clip or the caption you entered is not matching the one on the actual clip.<br> Sadly this is a Medal API limitation that doesn't seem possible to find a workaround for.</p>

                <p><strong>2 - Why is the embed not sending???</strong><br>
                It could be because it was not able to fetch something from Medal's API, so it didn't send due to an empty field.<br> If this happens, try another clip. If it still doesn't work, <a href="mailto:hi@awexxx.xyz">let me know</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>3 - What does "offset" mean? (old clip finder)</strong><br>
                Offset is how many objects (clips) it will skip before locking on. Set this to a high number (1000 is max) to recieve the first clip you made in that game.</p>

                <p><strong>4 - Where do I find my Medal ID?</strong><br>
                Your Medal ID is the final set of numbers in the <strong>https://medal.tv/users/</strong> URL. Go to your profile on the web and copy those.<br>For example: I go to https://medal.tv/lulawex and it turns into https://medal.tv/users/215577.</p>

                <p><strong>5 - Where do I find a Category ID?</strong><br>
                To find a Category ID, head <a href="">here</a> and press CTRL + F in the <strong>left</strong> panel, then type the name of your game.<br> To the left of the game name, look for <strong>categoryId</strong> and copy that number.</p>
